This is a React-Rails webpacker boilerplate w/ Postgress. Config is done for you.
Setup commands
- `bundle` should do the trick
- `yarn install` if you need to install new node modules
- `rake db:create && rake db:migrate` to setup your DB

Server commands
- `rails server`
- `npm start` (separate tab)

Honestly, config is easy enough that you should just be doing `rails new...` with a webpacker configuration.
Shout out to enthusiastick for showing me the ropes.
